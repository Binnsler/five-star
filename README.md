# Five Star App

A quick app for Five Star

### Setup

Make sure you have Nodemon and Node installed, since we will be using them.

Clone down the repository.

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/Binnsler/five-star.git
```

Install dependencies.

```javascript
npm install
```

Start up the dev server, bundle the app, and get started.

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Navigate to localhost:8080 to view the app.

Webpack bundles with /src/index.js as the starting point, which is a great place to begin reading the code.
